# Groovify
The music playing app that brings you songs you love by May Cooper, created from scratch using Javascript,  Python, MySQL, PHP, JQuery, Ajax, Apache, and more.

You have the ability to upload music, click on albums, and play songs. Additionally, playlists can be created, modified, and songs can be added or removed from them. Navigating to artists' pages allows you to explore their songs and albums. Moreover, you can update details and search for music artists and albums.
